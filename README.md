# PTZ camera control via Pelco protocol

This is a team-work project!

The project is about PTZ (Pan Tilt Zoom) which is used to control the PTZ camera via the RS-485 serial port. 
It supports several protocols such as Pelco, AD, Bosch, Sony, Panasonic, LG and Canon.
To accomplish this task we used a master(8051 microcontroller) and a slave(8051 microcontroller).
In the master are connected the buttons for orientation of the camera movement as well as an LCD, where the text is presented depending on which button we press.
